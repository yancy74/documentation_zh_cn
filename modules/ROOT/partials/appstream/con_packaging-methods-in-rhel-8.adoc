= {ProductShortName} {ProductNumber} 中的打包方法

// User Story: As a sysadmin, I need to know what is available through the AppStream so I can determine what RPMs, SCLs, and modules to download and install.

AppStream 仓库用两种方式打包：

单个 RPM 包::
传统的RPM包可供立即安装。


模块::
模块是表示逻辑单元的包的集合：应用程序、语言栈、数据库或一组工具。这些包是一起构建、测试和发布的。


// Software Collections::
// RPM packages in the traditional form, containing a specially prepared application that can be installed in multiple versions together.


// The traditional methods of package management and installation are transparently supported for all content. The appropriate combination of modules and streams is automatically used to enable installation of packages that depend on modular features.
